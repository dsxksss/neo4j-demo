1. Disease characteristics and symptoms
Relation: related, manifested, correlated
Alzheimer's disease is directly related to memory loss, indicating that memory impairment is one of its main symptoms. The manifestation (manifested in state) of the disease may include different cognitive and behavioral states. Moreover, Alzheimer's disease is correlated with dementia, underscoring the close link between the two.
2. Prevention and risk factors
Relationship: against, at risk
Education is seen as a defense against Alzheimer's disease, emphasizing the importance of raising public awareness and education. at the same time, certain populations are considered to be at higher risk for Alzheimer's disease, which may involve genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors.
3. Biomarkers and biological features
Relationships: showed, displayed, characterized, labeled, derived, use
This category covers multiple biological features and markers of Alzheimer's disease, These include showing specific receptors (showed receptor), showing changes in acetylcholinesterase activity (displayed acetylcholinesterase), through the production of amyloid (derived amyloid), and labeling of microglia (labeled microglia) to describe. These features and markers provide key information for the diagnosis of diseases and understanding their pathological mechanisms.
4. Research and treatment methods
Relation: remain, obtained, elevated, attenuated, use
Patients may need to remain at home, highlighting the impact of the disease on individuals and families. The obtained autopsy and use microscopy techniques were used in disease studies to obtain and analyze data. in addition, studies have examined the potential effects of substances such as nicotine, which may attenuate symptoms, and elevated levels of certain components in the brain.
