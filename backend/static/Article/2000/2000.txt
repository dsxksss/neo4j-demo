1. Etiology and biomarkers
Relationships: Derived, Produced, Caused, Characterized, Affecting, Includes
Alzheimer's disease is linked to many factors, For example, susceptibility caused by genes, brain derived, characterized by amyloid, produced by mitochondria, and caused by mutation. These triples point to potential biological markers and causes of the disease.
2. Research and education
Relation: Regarding, Advance, Accelerate, Since
research and education on Alzheimer's disease are advancing and accelerating, It covers many aspects such as basic research regarding Alzheimer's disease, public education regarding Alzheimer's disease and so on. This suggests that a deeper understanding of the disease and increased public awareness are seen as important steps in the fight against it.
