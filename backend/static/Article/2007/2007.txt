1. Treatment
Relations: Treated, Prescribe, Inhibit, Revolutionizing, Treating
Highlighting different strategies for treating AD, such as the use of risperidone, memantine, butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor inhibition, And revolutionizing the development of new drugs. Physician prescriptions and specific treatments such as immunizations are also mentioned.
2. Pathological features and biomarkers
Relationships: Characterized, Combined, the Contains, Correlate, Related, Fibrils, Characterised, Attributed, Associated, Cause
Multiple pathological features and biomarkers of AD are described, including association with cholesterol, copper, calcium, association with amyloid plaques, and the presence of fibers within the brain. AD is also characterized by relationships with memory and cellular functions.
3. Research focus and progress
Relationships: Suggests, Analyzed, Indicates, Disaggregate, Show
We show various directions in AD research, including suggestions for the role of CB2 receptors to explore new therapeutic avenues by disaggregating plaques and analyzing DNA. Studies also point to the effects of specific drugs, such as memantine, and the demonstration of disease cognition.
4. The relationship between AD and other diseases
Relationships: Coexist, Linking, Diabetes, Arthritis, Obesity
The relationship between AD and other health problems, especially hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and ankylosing spondylitis, was explored. This suggests that AD patients may have multiple concurrent diseases that require comprehensive management.
5. Risk factors and impacts
Relation: Antagonize, Predispose, Reduced
Factors that may increase the risk of AD or influence the progression of the disease, such as antagonism against respiratory mechanisms, and a propensity for exacerbations, are discussed. It also mentions how treatments can reduce anxiety.
6. Social and scientific cognition
Relationship: Growing, Increased incidence, Show awareness
We highlight the growing incidence of AD and the scientific community's concern about the disease, as well as the demonstration of society's understanding of AD. This reflects the growing public health concern and the importance of scientific research on AD.
