1. Association between health conditions and AD
Relationship: promote, diabetes, hypertension
Analysis: These triples suggest that hypertension and diabetes may contribute to the development of AD. For example, ['hypertension', 'promote', "Alzheimer's disease"] states that hypertension may increase the risk of AD, And ["Alzheimer's disease", 'diabetes', 'hypertension'] is associated with the co-occurrence of diabetes and hypertension with AD, suggesting that there may be interaction or common pathological mechanism between these metabolic diseases and AD.
2. Genetic factors
Relation: regulate, modifies, caused
Analysis: The role of ApoE ['ApoE', 'regulate', "Alzheimer's disease"] and its ability to modify the risk of AD ['APOE', 'modifies', "Alzheimer's disease"] highlights the importance of genetic factors in the development of AD. AD caused by Presenilin-1 ["Alzheimer's disease", 'caused', 'Presenilin-1'] further confirms a direct link between specific genetic variants and the pathogenesis of AD.
3. Research tools and methods
Relations: underwent, neuroimaging, captured
Analysis: Tools and methods used in AD research include autopsy ["Alzheimer's disease", 'underwent', 'autopsy'], neuroimaging datasets ["Alzheimer's disease", 'neuroimaging', 'dataset'] and biomarkers captured through these techniques ["Alzheimer's disease", 'captured', 'biomarkers']. These tools provide researchers with the means to gain insight into the pathological course of AD, as well as the possibility to diagnose and evaluate the effect of treatment.
4. Pathological features and therapeutic targets
Relation: presented, Activated, decrease, face-to-face, including, Targeting
Analysis: Pathological features of AD such as calmodulin expression ["Alzheimer's disease", 'presented', 'calmodulin'] and macrophage activation ["Alzheimer's disease", 'Activated', 'macrophages'] reveal potential therapeutic targets. In addition, AD treatment strategies are moving toward increasing neuroprotection ["Alzheimer's disease", 'decrease', 'neuroprotection'], promoting cell polarization ["Alzheimer's disease", 'Facilitating ', 'polarization'] and the maintenance of protein homeostasis ["Alzheimer's disease", 'including', 'proteostasis'].
5. Lifestyle and disease management
Relationship: treating, against, deliver, treat
Analysis: ['drug', 'treating', "Alzheimer's disease"], ['drug', 'treat', "Alzheimer's disease"] and ligand therapies for AD ['ligands', 'against', "Alzheimer's disease"] demonstrate current treatment options for managing the symptoms and progression of AD. The involvement of physicians ['physicians', 'deliver', "Alzheimer's disease"] is essential to implement an effective treatment plan.
6. Other related diseases
Relationships: with, coupled, interacts, associates
Analysis: AD is associated with other diseases, Such as with mental disease ["Alzheimer's disease", 'with', 'schizophrenia'], ['risk', 'developing', "Alzheimer's disease"], psychological condition ["Alzheimer's disease", 'coupled', 'psychological'], educational interaction ["Alzheimer's disease", 'interact', 'education'] and the relationship between lipoprotein [" Alzheimer 's diseases ",' associates', 'lipoproteins] is pointed out that the complexity of the AD, not only is a kind of neurodegenerative diseases, is associated with a variety of physical and psychological factors.
