1. Genetic factors and biomarkers
Relationships: associated, describe, investigated
The association of Alzheimer's disease with the APOE gene reveals the role of genetic factors in the development of the disease. describe mutations in disease and studies of specific molecules such as investigated interleukin-6 further highlight the importance of the molecular level for understanding disease mechanisms.
2. Pathological features and diagnosis
Relations: characterized, including, Pathology, confirm
The pathological features characterized by amyloid include the accumulation of amyloid protein, which is a key indicator for disease diagnosis and research. These findings were further validated by Pathology in Alzheimer's disease and autopsy confirm Alzheimer's disease.
Risk factors and disease progression
Relationships: counterbalanced, aging, risk developing
Certain processes of memory decline may be balanced with the development of Alzheimer's disease (counterbalanced memory), and changes in memory with age (memory aging) and risk of developing the disease (risk developing) highlight the complex and multifactorial nature of disease progression.
4. Molecular and biochemical studies
Relations: examined, damage, immunoreact, suggest
The study of certain chemical elements such as Tellurium (examined Tellurium) and their damage to mitochondria (damage mitochondria) has explored the possible influence of environmental factors on Alzheimer's disease. In addition, immunoreact antigens in disease and the biochemical processes that suggest activation provide important insights into the molecular basis of disease mechanisms.
