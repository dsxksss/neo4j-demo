1. Genetic and molecular biology research
Relationship: epsilon4_associated, have, associated, demonstrate, confirmed, determine, found, activates, suggests, revealed,  indicating
The association of ApoE ε4 allele with Alzheimer's disease (epsilon4_associated) and other genetic factors (mutation, trisomy) play an important role in the study of genetic background of the disease. In addition, the study of RNA, Bcl_2 protein, microglia activation, α-synuclein revealed the molecular mechanism and pathological process of the disease.
2. Medication
Relationship: treating, taking, receiving
The use of Tacrine indicates a treatment attempt for Alzheimer's disease, either being treated or considered as a treatment.
3. Pathological features and diagnostic methods of the disease
Relationships: shows, procedure isolates, derived
Alzheimer's disease shows pathology, as well as the study of specific procedure isolates and derived amyloid, providing a key perspective on the diagnosis and understanding of the disease.
4. Risk factors and disease mechanisms
Relationship: Because, reach, respect
Risk factors for the disease include diabetes and accidents, among others, as well as mechanisms associated with galanin, showing the influence of disease complexity and multifactorial factors. There is a reach consensus on some aspects of the disease, such as sporadic incidence.
5. Other research and treatment advances
Relations: Using, with, presented, has
Studies Using chromatography and with sleep and presented Melatonin demonstrate the diversity of disease research and the exploration of emerging treatments.
