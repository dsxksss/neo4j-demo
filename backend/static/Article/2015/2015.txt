1. Biomarkers and disease mechanisms
Relationship: related, demonstrated, reduced, hyperactivated, in, known, precipitate, Discovering, characterized, implicates,  detected, related, suggests
Analysis: Examples such as [['Acetylcholine', 'reduced', "Alzheimer's disease"]] and [["Alzheimer's disease", 'demonstrated', The triple of 'serum']] highlights the role of biomarkers in AD diagnosis and understanding pathological mechanisms. For example, ['Acetylcholine', 'reduced', "Alzheimer's disease"] reveals a relationship between reduced acetylcholine levels and AD, one of the common neurotransmitter changes in AD. [["Alzheimer's disease", 'known', 'antioxidants"]] points out the potential link between antioxidants and AD, suggesting that antioxidant strategies may be beneficial in the prevention and treatment of AD.
2. Treatment and drug research
Relation: treating, against, treat, as, investigated, activated, reduce, aiming, treat, against, used, treat
Analysis: drugs and strategies for treating AD, such as [['drugs', 'treating', "Alzheimer's disease"]] and [['Caffeine', 'against', "Alzheimer's disease"]], demonstrate diverse therapeutic avenues. These triples highlight therapeutic explorations ranging from caffeine to more traditional drugs such as memantine. The triples [['galantamine', 'as', "Alzheimer's disease"]] and [['liraglutide', 'against', "Alzheimer's disease"]] provide specific drug names, The potential role of these drugs in AD treatment or ongoing research is indicated.
3. Pathological studies and disease models
Relations: analyzed, neuroimaging, defines, through, s, in
Analysis: Pathological studies of AD and disease models used, such as [["Alzheimer's disease", 'neuroimaging', 'dataset']] and [["Alzheimer's disease", 'in', 'Drosophila']], The importance of research tools and models is pointed out. The analysis of neuroimaging datasets can help to understand the structural and functional changes in the brain of AD, and the use of models such as Drosophila can provide insights into the genetic and biological mechanisms of AD at the molecular level.
4. Disease effects and associated symptoms
Relation: interferes, interferes, found, interferes, between, suggests
Analysis: Discussion of the effects of AD on patients and related symptoms, such as [["Alzheimer's disease", 'interferes', 'memory']] and [["Alzheimer's disease", 'interference ', 'libido']], It highlights how AD affects cognitive function and daily life of patients. These triples reveal that AD may affect mood and other neuropsychological functions in addition to memory loss.
